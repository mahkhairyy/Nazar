👁️ About Nazar – The Watchful Eye of Online Safety
Nazar (نظر) is an AI-powered platform designed to safeguard digital spaces by detecting and classifying toxic comments in Arabic, with a special focus on the Egyptian dialect. Inspired by the Arabic word "نظر" meaning "watchful eye," Nazar reflects vigilance, protection, and cultural awareness in maintaining respectful conversations online.

At its core, Nazar leverages the power of transformer-based models like DistilBERT, fine-tuned on real-world toxic comment datasets. The system evaluates content based on linguistic and contextual cues to determine if a comment is toxic, clean, or in future updates—threatening, insulting, or obscene.

🌐 Why Nazar?

✅ Accurate, context-aware analysis of Arabic comments

💬 Support for both single comments and batch file uploads

📊 Confidence-based results and visualization

🧠 Ongoing learning from real-world interactions

🎯 Our Mission
